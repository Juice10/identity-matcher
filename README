IdentityMatcher
===============

This is a Rails plugin that adds the ability to import social networks from sites such as Twitter and Gmail. Put it in your vendor/plugins directory. 


Example
=======

Add this line to your app's User model:

  matches_identities :nickname_field => 'realname', :email_field => 'work_email', :username_field => 'login'

and your user model will gain the following methods:

  User.match_gmail(username, password)
  User.match_gmail_api(authsub_token)
  User.match_twitter(nick)
  User.match_hcard(url)
  etc...

The return value is a two-element list. The first element is a list of User objects that match the identities found in the external source. The second element, if available for that mode of matching, is a list of found external identities that weren't matched, giving their name and email address in a hash.

The default values for matches_identities are:
  :nickname_field => 'name'     # used for real name, alias or nickname columns (eg. "John Doe")
  :username_field => 'username' # used for login or username columns (eg. "johndoe")
  :email_field    => 'email'    # email, 'nuff said
